        <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Rather than rote memorization and exam scores, my teaching philosophy emphasizes comprehension, active recall, and retention. Students, in my opinion, learn best when they are engaged in the content and have the opportunity to put what they are learning into practice.

            I include new and innovative teaching techniques into my classes, but I take care not to confuse kids with new and dangerous technologies. I only utilize technology that has been shown to be useful while also respecting students' privacy.
            
            For example, to assist pupils in learning and remembering new knowledge, I employ spaced repetition software. Spaced repetition software works by delivering information to pupils at gradually increasing intervals, allowing them to move information from their short-term memory to their long-term memory.
       
            <br><br>            

            In addition, I employ flipped classroom instruction. Students in a flipped classroom study video lectures or read articles at home before using class time to work on problems, discuss with classmates, and ask questions. Students can learn at their own pace and obtain help when they need it.

            I think that all kids have the ability to succeed, and I am dedicated to providing a learning environment in which all students feel safe, supported, and challenged. I want my pupils to leave my class with a thorough comprehension of the topic as well as the skills necessary for future success. 

            <br><br>

            I can also utilize technology to assist pupils learn about and practice digital citizenship skills. For example, I can educate children how to judge the authenticity of internet sources, how to preserve their privacy online, and how to use technology responsibly.

I think that technology may be a tremendous tool for learning, but it must be used responsibly. I will only utilize technology in my classroom that is productive, respectful of students' freedom, and assists students in meeting their learning objectives.
