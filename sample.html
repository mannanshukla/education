            Even though I haven't had a lot of experience when it comes to educating others, especially in a classroom setting, I hope the below demonstrates my abilities well.

        <p>
            I was president and founder of the Hackathon Club at Robbinsville HS. As part of an outreach program to 8th graders, we created a workshop program to help 8th graders become more interested in Computer Security through a "Capture the Flag" challenge that we guided them through. That's me at the top, pink shirt.

            I'm the President of RUSLUG (Rutgers University Student Linux User's Group) We talk about Linux and free software, sometimes I have to lecture in front of the group. I try to incorporate humor, audience interaction, and slides in order to make sure that I told the attention of the club members in attendence.
